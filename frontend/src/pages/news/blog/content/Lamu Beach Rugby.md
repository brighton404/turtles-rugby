I love to support Rugby as a game and Lamu Rugby Tournament is an initiative of Waridi Foundation that we began in 2017 with only 4 teams. It’s a game of strong, muscular, wit and sprinters who are so disciplined. They never fight for because they are strong ,They don’t beat people or fight after they don’t win but they Fight for the balls. They fight to be the first to put the ball down first ,Interesting game indeed that all sportsmen and women ought to embrace,” Ms Jenniffer Wairimu explained.
