/* 
The terms "Gold," "Silver," and "Platinum" are often used to denote different sponsorship levels for a rugby team, with Platinum being the highest and most prestigious level. Here's a breakdown of the typical differences:

Platinum Sponsor:

Highest Level of Investment: Platinum sponsors typically make the largest financial contribution to the team.
Extensive Branding Opportunities: They receive the most prominent branding placements, such as:
    Primary Jersey Sponsorship: Their logo is displayed prominently on the team's jerseys.
    Exclusive Naming Rights: They may have the right to name the stadium or a specific area within it.
    Extensive Advertising: Their brand is featured on LED boards, scoreboards, and other high-visibility areas during matches.
VIP Treatment: Platinum sponsors often receive VIP hospitality packages, including exclusive access to players, coaches, and matchday events.
Marketing and PR Support: The team may provide significant marketing and public relations support to promote the sponsor's brand.

Gold Sponsor:

Significant Investment: Gold sponsors make a substantial financial contribution, but typically less than Platinum sponsors.
Prominent Branding: They receive prominent branding placements, such as:
    Secondary Jersey Sponsorship: Their logo may be displayed on a less prominent area of the team's jerseys.
    Advertising Space: They may have advertising space on LED boards, scoreboards, and other areas within the stadium.
    Matchday Hospitality: They may receive hospitality packages, but potentially with less exclusivity than Platinum sponsors.
Marketing and PR Support: The team may provide some marketing and public relations support to promote the sponsor's brand.

Silver Sponsor:

Moderate Investment: Silver sponsors make a moderate financial contribution to the team.
Limited Branding Opportunities: They may receive some branding opportunities, such as:
    Advertising Space: They may have advertising space in the team's matchday program or on the team's website.
    Matchday Hospitality: They may receive some hospitality benefits, but typically less than Gold or Platinum sponsors.
Limited Marketing and PR Support: The team may provide limited marketing and public relations support to promote the sponsor's brand.

Key Points:

* The specific benefits and costs associated with each sponsorship level can vary significantly depending on the team, the league, and the specific agreement.
* Teams may also offer other sponsorship levels, such as Bronze or even higher levels above Platinum (e.g., Diamond).
* The value of a sponsorship is not solely determined by the financial contribution, but also by the exposure and brand recognition it provides.

To get a more accurate understanding of the specific differences between sponsorship levels for a particular rugby team, it's best to consult the team's official sponsorship information or contact them directly.
